Dan Patton,"Background

Dan's grandparents immigrated from the United Kingdom, shortly after marrying, when his grandmother became a Broadway actress cast as Gloria Thorpe in Damn Yankees*

His mother went on to star in Beauty and the Beast in the mid 90's on Broadway, and theatre has been in his blood ever since.

He, of course, was in all aspects of high school theatre, from set building, lighting, sound, and of course acting.  His favorite high school play was Pippin, mostly because he got to wield a sword, which lead to another favorite hobby LARPing and Medieval Reenactment.

He become quite the proficient sword fighter, and joined the fencing team at MU, along with the theatre, and the history department so he could really get into the reenactment part.

Miskatonic University

When Dan was looking for colleges, he first was looking for theatre and history, but when he saw that MU has Occult Studies as well as Modern History, the Survery of Europen History, he was sold.  He had just fallen into a rathole about Masonic symbols and the FreeMasons, and everything just came together.

As there's no formal Theatre department, he's taken it upon himself to do One Person plays in the commons and pick up some odd roles here and there in the community theatre.  

Dan would probably get along swimmingly with Alex, and he would be constantly called a luddite by Marcus. Also, as there’s not a theatre department, History friends it is.

Dan may also have a relationship with Chloe based on incessant pestering questions about what the environments would have been like, back in medieval times, and learning that a lot of the 'truths' of the medieval era were 'white washed' by history and didn't match up with the research

*Reporter : Do you think Washington will win the pennant?
Gloria Thorpe : Yeah, when I swim the Channel.

From his journal

""While you partied, I studied the blade""
Studui ferrum - I studied iron

Fuck that, not even meme worthy

I studied the sword - Studeo gladio

There we go, that's meme worthy, for what it's worth.

God, even better ...

Histrio sum - I am an actor

Lord, it gets even better ... Why is this a dead Language? It's amazing!

I therefore meditated on the sword, I am a player - meditatus sum igitur gladium, ego sum lusor

Lusor (loser) - player

Next time they call me a loser, I'll just say thank you, I am a player! .... right /sigh

Herschel Flynn,"Name: Herschel Flynn
Age: 20
Occupation: Microbiology Student at Miskatonic University

Background:
Herschel grew up in Hartford, Connecticut, where he lived a sheltered life due to his health issues. His early childhood was marked by frequent hospital visits and a rigorous regimen of medications, fostering a deep fear of germs and contamination. His father, Sean, of Irish and English descent, was an alcoholic and an IT Field Service Technician. The instability caused by his father's behavior led to his parents' divorce, after which Herschel was primarily raised by his mother, Hanna, a dedicated nurse of Polish and Jewish descent. Since she was a single mother that often had to work long hours, Herschel spent a lot of time under the care of his grandparents. Herschel's biological father moved away and practically vanished after the divorce. Eventually, his mother remarried - a doctor and a decent man, but Herschel never really connected with him. He did bond with his grandfather quite a bit, as they shared a common love of science, especially natural sciences and loved to discuss both ancient history (Dinosaurs!) and the  possibilities of the future. His great grandfather - whom Herchel was named after, was an eccentric scientist himself. 

Herschel's fascination with microbiology began as a coping mechanism—understanding the microscopic world gave him a sense of control over his fears. His academic pursuits at Miskatonic University are supported by his mother and fueled by his personal challenges. His social interactions are limited as he prefers to spend much time alone or with a few close friends, reflecting his introverted and thoughtful nature.

A strange heirloom - a pocket watch with  a Victorian microscope slide embedded within its flip cover, was passed down through the family, eventually landing in Hershel's possession. A The slide contains a permanently sealed sample that never decays. The sample is of an unknown biological material that occasionally seems to move when not being directly observed.

","Date of birth- August 1, 2003

Place of birth- Los Angeles, California (Downtown LA)

Listen, if anyone tells you Los Angeles is all glitz and glamour, they need to stop watching movies and take a wander into West Adams, or Compton, or the Fashion District- maybe literal Skid Row- otherwise known as a few of the places I called home. I suspect my mother was drawn to the dream of being a star, from what little I remember (and what I read of my file) she was a runaway--I have no idea from where--who instead of living the Hollywood dream, lived a California nightmare. She was young when I was born--young when she died.  Hell, at the age of 20, I have surpassed her. She died of an OD when I was two, I have vague flashes of it, mostly trying to wake her up, but she wouldn't move. It was when she didn't show up for one of her regulars (yeah, Johns, how classy is that) that someone came looking. They found her dead and me in my own filth, half starved and dehydrated. The thing was, though, no one knew who my mother really was, where she came from, or who to call--her ID was fake, there was no record of her anywhere, and of course, who knows who my father is?

So, I was raised in the system. There was a few attempts at adoption and foster care, people were always interested--I was white and blonde (ugh, like that should make a difference) and pretty quiet, but I had ""behavioural issues"", so nothing really stuck. By the time I was eight, I was regularly in homes, and it was okay. Yeah, the staff was lousy and the food was horrible and a lot of the kids were assholes--but a lot of them were like me, you know, parents were addicts, either dead or in prison, and it was a safe place. We had beds, showers, hand me down clothes, etc. Where I took solace, though, was school! There, I could get away. There were always bullies and idiot teachers sometimes. One, though was far from an idiot--my third grade teacher, Miss Mia.  She was new and fresh faced and she saw how quickly I went through my class work and I was always asking questions or taking advantage of reading time once we got our work done. She went to my case worker, Audry Chao (who I really liked) and asked if I could be tested for the district's gifted program. Mrs Chao was hesitant at first, but agreed and I was to start in the GP the next school season.

Oh, the Gifted Program! It was a small program--a dozen kids in each grade. We didn't have regular classrooms, we had rooms attached to the library, one for each grade, and they were huge! We had a big table and bean bags and so many books! Morning session was Math and Science, then we had PE before lunch and Art after lunch with the other kids, and afternoons was Literature and History. I was in heaven! Most of the teachers liked me and I would hang out at the library before and after school. The other kids, though, well, let's just say that it is hard for a kid in my situation to relate. But, it was okay, I had books and access to a good computer and that made it all better. GP prepared me for my next challenge, High School--and, through lots of pencil pushing and writing letters of intent, hard work, and advocacy, Mr Harris (the head of the GP) was able to get me into one of the best schools in LA- Polytechnical in Pasadena.

The school part, well, that was easy. I loved every second, and I even made a few friends (and, you know, friends). I excelled, particularly in visual arts and science, and I was challenged on how to combine them.  There was even more of a separation between my home life and my school life, a sharp contrast. School was great, home was'.strange. To be closer to school, Mrs Chao got me into a smaller home in Pasadena, at 1003 S Orange Grove, a quick bike ride between the two. It was really nice, at least, it seemed so.  There were six of us in the house, the others were 17 or 18--it was one of those places that prepared us for life outside of the system. It was a private home, I am sure it was subsidised by the state, but wasn't state run. We had a day admin, who made sure we were accounted for--Gerald McCoy--he was pretty cool, working on his Masters in Social Work, and had been raised in the system. We had a ""Night Mother"", Leslie Freeman, she was in her 30s and took no bull from any of us, she was stern but would sometimes let me sit on the couch with her to watch movies as she filled out reports. We were in charge of keeping our selves and our rooms clean--there were two good sized bedrooms, three of us in each (separated by gender, of course). I didn't get along with most of my house mates--I was too young, too privileged, too blonde. I vibed with one person, though, Brandon. They were 17 when I got there, queer as fuck (probably the first male presenting person I had met in ages that didn't try to get under my shirt) and an artist.  They had been kicked out of their home young for their sexuality and gender expression, so bounced around in homeless shelters until they ended up at Orange Grove. We would get high and do art, sometimes even using each other as our canvas.  They were like a sibling to me, the closest friend I had until I started college.

It was one of those nights that Brandon told me about the house- they called it the Parsonage and said that sometimes, they heard whispers, the sounds of chanting and sometimes wild sex, and explosions.  They told me that it was during one of those times that they heard someone call the place the Parsonage. Oh, and when ever they would hear these sounds' well, the next day, one of residents of the house would go missing. Not for long, strangely enough, two or three days, and then the person would turn back up, with no memory of where they had been. The strangest thing, though, is that neither Gerard or Leslie seemed overly surprised, but Brandon had seen Leslie with larger stacks of paperwork when ever someone went missing. Our caretakers weren't as calm if someone went off on a bender--then they were mad, but if the disappearance was preceded by Brandon hearing sounds, then it was fine. They told me that they weren't the first one to hear the voices, others who had graduated out of Orange Grove had, too. I didn't think anything of it until one night I heard moaning coming from the basement, I walked down to see who was hooking up (Leslie barely looked up from her diet coke and paperwork as I snuck down there). When I got to the basement, no one was there- but it smelled like smoke and perfume, bourbon and vodka, and sex. And then, there was a flash and I heard an explosion- and it all went dark. I stood there for a few minutes until I heard a sound behind me, Leslie put her hand on my shoulder and told me I had been sleep walking (I had not), and walked me to my room.

The next morning, I was making a quick breakfast of a redbull and cinnamon toast crunch while reading my physics notes. Brandon had a shift at Arlington Gardens, where they were an apprentice to the landscaper, and would normally join me for breakfast. They weren't there. I ran up to the guys room and Tre'vell told me that Brandon never showed up to the room last night. I called, no answer. And, worst of all, Brandon's bike was still outside. It seemed I was the one hearing sounds now that preceded when someone went missing. As I left for school, I saw that Gerard was on the phone and seemed strangely calm. I got to school early and went to the library and started digging into the location--and the name Brandon called it--the Parsonage. It took less than a minute- -a literal rocket scientist named Jack Whiteside Parsons had owned the land that the condo was on, he died in a mercury explosion in 1952 that destroyed his home, which was called the Parsonage. And, get this--Jack Parsons was not just a scientist, but an occultist--his place was a boarding house to artists, bohemians, and others involved in the mystic arts. The basement was a regular sight of orgies and rituals--he knew Aleister fucking Crowley and had a magical beef with L. Ron Hubbard. Was this what was happening--did Brandon--and now me, somehow hear the past? And why did people go missing and then come back with no memory.

As was the pattern, Brandon did the same--two days later ( I was frantic, I really didn't believe what as going on and spent every available second researching or calling their friends to see if they were out there), they were sitting at the breakfast table as I came downstairs- -No memory, but smelled just like the basement had--a sticky sweet smoke, strong bourbon, and sex. My friend looked high as fuck, and not just on our normal weed. They  didn't even know he  had been missing, nor did they know why he had a message on his phone from his boss that he was fired.  Brandon, in normal fashion, threw their hands up in the air and said they were going to take the bus to the arts district to find a new job, once they took a shower. And, that was it.

That was it for them, but I became obsessed--did he slip in time? Did they  go somewhere else and not know it? This led me deeper into the rabbit hole, not just on the Parsonage, but science--both proven and theoretical--time travel and cosmic string theory. I read everything I could get my hands on, quantum mechanics, theoretical physics--all of it! My teachers were impressed, even, would suggest lectures and help me get to CalTech on half days to sit in on classes, I started documenting my own work and theories, not with the intent of getting published, but with figuring out what happened to my friend. I hung out in the basement when ever I could, but I never heard the voices again, and the rest of the time I lived there, no one else went missing.

 My obsession got me to MU on a full scholarship, they wanted to admit me early but Mrs. Chao couldn't push the paperwork through.  She was on it, though, the second I turned 18, she had the papers in front of me to get me to MU, had me on a bus by 11 AM with what little belongings I had--going from orphan to student at one of the most prestigious colleges in the United States.",honey_charles.png,Lost angel from Los Angeles,pcs,"Honey, Ms. Charles, Miss Charles"

Whispering Pines,Awaiting Eldritch bullshit,"Welcome to Whispering Pines, a secluded and picturesque town nestled deep in the mist-shrouded forests of New England. With its charming Victorian architecture and timeless natural beauty, the town beckons you to uncover its secrets. But beneath its tranquil surface, Whispering Pines harbors a dark and forgotten past.

As part of a summer program, you and your fellow students from Miskatonic University have volunteered to help revitalize the dilapidated St. Margaret’s Sanatorium. Once a renowned retreat for mental health, the sanatorium fell into disrepair and disuse decades ago. Now, thanks to the sponsorship of Veil Neurosciences, a cutting-edge biotech company, there is hope to transform the crumbling institution into a modern community health center. 

Whispering Pines may seem like an idyllic small town, but appearances can be deceiving. Sometimes, the most picturesque places hide the darkest secrets, waiting to be uncovered by those who dare to look beyond the surface. As you dig deeper, you may find that the whispers of the past are not so easily silenced, and the shadows hold more than just memories.",whispering_pines.png,Future site of sanity loss,other,"Whispering Pines, The Pines"

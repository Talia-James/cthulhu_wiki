","Date of birth- August 1, 2003

Place of birth- Los Angeles, California (Downtown LA)

Listen, if anyone tells you Los Angeles is all glitz and glamour, they need to stop watching movies and take a wander into West Adams, or Compton, or the Fashion District- maybe literal Skid Row- otherwise known as a few of the places I called home. I suspect my mother was drawn to the dream of being a star, from what little I remember (and what I read of my file) she was a runaway--I have no idea from where--who instead of living the Hollywood dream, lived a California nightmare. She was young when I was born--young when she died.  Hell, at the age of 20, I have surpassed her. She died of an OD when I was two, I have vague flashes of it, mostly trying to wake her up, but she wouldn't move. It was when she didn't show up for one of her regulars (yeah, Johns, how classy is that) that someone came looking. They found her dead and me in my own filth, half starved and dehydrated. The thing was, though, no one knew who my mother really was, where she came from, or who to call--her ID was fake, there was no record of her anywhere, and of course, who knows who my father is?

So, I was raised in the system. There was a few attempts at adoption and foster care, people were always interested--I was white and blonde (ugh, like that should make a difference) and pretty quiet, but I had ""behavioural issues"", so nothing really stuck. By the time I was eight, I was regularly in homes, and it was okay. Yeah, the staff was lousy and the food was horrible and a lot of the kids were assholes--but a lot of them were like me, you know, parents were addicts, either dead or in prison, and it was a safe place. We had beds, showers, hand me down clothes, etc. Where I took solace, though, was school! There, I could get away. There were always bullies and idiot teachers sometimes. One, though was far from an idiot--my third grade teacher, Miss Mia.  She was new and fresh faced and she saw how quickly I went through my class work and I was always asking questions or taking advantage of reading time once we got our work done. She went to my case worker, Audry Chao (who I really liked) and asked if I could be tested for the district's gifted program. Mrs Chao was hesitant at first, but agreed and I was to start in the GP the next school season.

Oh, the Gifted Program! It was a small program--a dozen kids in each grade. We didn't have regular classrooms, we had rooms attached to the library, one for each grade, and they were huge! We had a big table and bean bags and so many books! Morning session was Math and Science, then we had PE before lunch and Art after lunch with the other kids, and afternoons was Literature and History. I was in heaven! Most of the teachers liked me and I would hang out at the library before and after school. The other kids, though, well, let's just say that it is hard for a kid in my situation to relate. But, it was okay, I had books and access to a good computer and that made it all better. GP prepared me for my next challenge, High School--and, through lots of pencil pushing and writing letters of intent, hard work, and advocacy, Mr Harris (the head of the GP) was able to get me into one of the best schools in LA- Polytechnical in Pasadena.

The school part, well, that was easy. I loved every second, and I even made a few friends (and, you know, friends). I excelled, particularly in visual arts and science, and I was challenged on how to combine them.  There was even more of a separation between my home life and my school life, a sharp contrast. School was great, home was'.strange. To be closer to school, Mrs Chao got me into a smaller home in Pasadena, at 1003 S Orange Grove, a quick bike ride between the two. It was really nice, at least, it seemed so.  There were six of us in the house, the others were 17 or 18--it was one of those places that prepared us for life outside of the system. It was a private home, I am sure it was subsidised by the state, but wasn't state run. We had a day admin, who made sure we were accounted for--Gerald McCoy--he was pretty cool, working on his Masters in Social Work, and had been raised in the system. We had a ""Night Mother"", Leslie Freeman, she was in her 30s and took no bull from any of us, she was stern but would sometimes let me sit on the couch with her to watch movies as she filled out reports. We were in charge of keeping our selves and our rooms clean--there were two good sized bedrooms, three of us in each (separated by gender, of course). I didn't get along with most of my house mates--I was too young, too privileged, too blonde. I vibed with one person, though, Brandon. He was 17 when I got there, queer as fuck (probably the first guy I had met in ages that didn't try to get under my shirt) and an artist.  He had been kicked out of his home young for his sexuality, so bounced around in homeless shelters until he ended up at Orange Grove. We would get high and do art, sometimes even using each other as our canvas. He was like a brother to me, the closest friend I had until I started college.

It was one of those nights that Brandon told me about the house--he called it the Parsonage and said that sometimes, he heard whispers, the sounds of chanting and sometimes wild sex, and explosions.  He told me that it was during one of those times that he heard someone call the place the Parsonage. Oh, and when ever he would hear these sounds' well, the next day, one of residents of the house would go missing. Not for long, strangely enough, two or three days, and then they would turn back up, with no memory of where they had been. The strangest thing, though, is that neither Gerard or Leslie seemed overly surprised, but he had seen Leslie with larger stacks of paperwork when ever someone went missing. Our caretakers weren't as calm if someone went off on a bender--then they were mad, but if the disappearance was preceded by Brandon hearing sounds, then it was fine. He told me that he wasn't the first one to hear the voices, others who had graduated out of Orange Grove had, too. I didn't think anything of it until one night I heard moaning coming from the basement, I walked down to see who was hooking up (Leslie barely looked up from her diet coke and paperwork as I snuck down there). When I got to the basement, no one was there- but it smelled like smoke and perfume, bourbon and vodka, and sex. And then, there was a flash and I heard an explosion- and it all went dark. I stood there for a few minutes until I heard a sound behind me, Leslie put her hand on my shoulder and told me I had been sleep walking (I had not), and let me to my room.

The next morning, I was making a quick breakfast of a redbull and cinnamon toast crunch while reading my physics notes. Brandon had a shift at Arlington Gardens, where he was an apprentice to the landscaper, and would normally join me for breakfast. He wasn't there. I ran up to the guys room and Tre'vell told me that Brandon never showed up to the room last night. I called, no answer. And, worst of all, Brandon's bike was still outside. It seemed I was the one hearing sounds now that preceded when someone went missing. As I left for school, I saw that Gerard was on the phone and seemed strangely calm. I got to school early and went to the library and started digging into the location--and the name Brandon called it--the Parsonage. It took less than a minute- -a literal rocket scientist named Jack Whiteside Parsons had owned the land that the condo was on, he died in a mercury explosion in 1952 that destroyed his home, which was called the Parsonage. And, get this--Jack Parsons was not just a scientist, but an occultist--his place was a boarding house to artists, bohemians, and others involved in the mystic arts. The basement was a regular sight of orgies and rituals--he knew Aleister Crowley and had been with fucking L. Ron Hubbard. Was this what was happening--did Brandon--and now me, somehow hear the past? And why did people go missing and then come back with no memory.

As was the pattern, Brandon did the same--two days later ( I was frantic, I really didn't believe what as going on and spent every available second researching or calling his friends to see if he was out there), he was sitting at the breakfast table as I came downstairs- -No memory, but he smelled just like the basement had--a sticky sweet smoke, strong bourbon, and sex. He looked high as fuck, and not just on our normal weed. He didn't even know he  had been missing, nor did he know why he had a message on his phone from his boss that he was fired.  Brandon, in his normal fashion, threw his hands up in the air and said he was going to take the bus to the arts district to find a new job, once he took a shower. And, that was it.

That was it for him,but I became obsessed--did he slip in time? Did he go somewhere else and not know it? This led me deeper into the rabbit hole, not just on the Parsonage, but science--both proven and theoretical--time travel and cosmic string theory. I read everything I could get my hands on, quantum mechanics, theoretical physics--all of it! My teachers were impressed, even, would suggest lectures and help me get to CalTech on half days to sit in on classes, I started documenting my own work and theories, not with the intent of getting published, but with figuring out what happened to my friend. I hung out in the basement when ever I could, but I never heard the voices again, and the rest of the time I lived there, no one else went missing.

 My obsession got me to MU on a full scholarship, they wanted to admit me early but Mrs. Chao couldn't push the paperwork through.  She was on it, though, the second I turned 18, she had the papers in front of me to get me to MU, had me on a bus by 11 AM with what little belongings I had--going from orphan to student at one of the most prestigious colleges in the United States.",honey_charles.png,Lost angel from Los Angeles,pcs,"Honey, Ms. Charles, Miss Charles"

Whispering Pines,Awaiting Eldritch bullshit,"Welcome to Whispering Pines, a secluded and picturesque town nestled deep in the mist-shrouded forests of New England. With its charming Victorian architecture and timeless natural beauty, the town beckons you to uncover its secrets. But beneath its tranquil surface, Whispering Pines harbors a dark and forgotten past.

As part of a summer program, you and your fellow students from Miskatonic University have volunteered to help revitalize the dilapidated St. Margaret’s Sanatorium. Once a renowned retreat for mental health, the sanatorium fell into disrepair and disuse decades ago. Now, thanks to the sponsorship of Veil Neurosciences, a cutting-edge biotech company, there is hope to transform the crumbling institution into a modern community health center. 

Whispering Pines may seem like an idyllic small town, but appearances can be deceiving. Sometimes, the most picturesque places hide the darkest secrets, waiting to be uncovered by those who dare to look beyond the surface. As you dig deeper, you may find that the whispers of the past are not so easily silenced, and the shadows hold more than just memories.",whispering_pines.png,Future site of sanity loss,other,"Whispering Pines, The Pines"
